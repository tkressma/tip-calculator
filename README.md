## My process

As with most of my projects, I begin designing the mobile layout. I first developed the header and main card-style body which will later hold the entirety of the project. In order to get this design to feel right, I had to ensure the input field looked and functioned as it should. I first started with the input fields, paying special attention to the small icons that appear in them, followed by the tip selection buttons. At this point, I was unsure about how to approach the issue of accessibility within my input field. I ultimately ended up utilizing the "aria-label" attribute to increase the overall usability of the application. Towards the end of the development process of the mobile design, I began to work on the functionality of the calculator itself. After squashing many bugs, I ended up with a working tip calculator. As a final step, I introduced media queries to implement a proper layou for those viewing the application on a tablets as well as a desktop display.

### Built with

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Component-Scoped Styles with CSS Modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Useful resources

- ["ARIA14: Using aria-label to provide an invisible label where a visible label cannot be used"](https://www.https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA14.html.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
